The Caesar cipher is an ancient encryption algorithm used by Julius Caesar. 

We can both encrypt and decrypt, or just encrypt or decrypt using this code. 

We call the length of shift the key. For example, if the key is 3, then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and so on. 

To decrypt the message, you must shift the encrypted letters in the opposite direction. 

This program lets the user encrypt and decrypt messages according to this algorithm.
